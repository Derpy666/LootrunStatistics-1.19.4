# LootrunStatistics

A mod for Wynncraft that records your lootrun statistics.

## Installation

Download the latest version of the mod. (You can find it to the right under "Releases" or you can download it [here](https://github.com/McPlayHD/LootrunStatistics/releases/download/beta-v0.3/lootrunstatistics-0.3.jar) directly.)

Put the compiled `.jar` file into your `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods/` folder.

In order for the chest level range displaying to work you have to install Wynntils (https://wynntils.com/) by also placing it into the `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods/` folder.

**Not compatible with chestcountmod.**
